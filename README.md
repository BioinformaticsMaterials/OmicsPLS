# Update

For now, **install** the package by typing in

    devtools::install_github("selbouhaddani/O2PLS", rep = "Upgrade")
    library(O2PLS)

The Upgrade branch contains the latest developments, but might cause broken code from time to time.
If the installation **failed**, try the *tar* or *zip* (Windows) from my *ZippedPackages* repo: *selbouhaddani/ZippedPackages*.

# The O2PLS R package

Welcome to the O2PLS package page on Github!

O2PLS is designed for integrating two high dimensional datasets and the O2PLS package is an implementation of this method. 

Install the package with:

    devtools::install_github("selbouhaddani/O2PLS")
    library(O2PLS)

If that doesn't work, try the source .tar.gz or the Windows binaries .zip in my *ZippedPackaged* repo.

For an overview of what is possible, see the help file after you installed and loaded O2PLS:

    ?O2PLS

For questions, complaints, bugs, etc, you can mail me or file an issue.
